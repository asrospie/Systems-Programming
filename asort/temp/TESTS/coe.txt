Accept cheerfully my full share of any task, however, menial, involved in mainting a chapter home
Help create in my chapter home an environment in which enduring friendships may be formed
Maintain a creditable scholastic record
Maintain my self-respect by proper conduct at all times
Observe the precepts of the Fraternity as set forth in the Ritual
Pay all personal bills promptly, and always live within my means
Pay the price of success in honest effort.
Preserve and promote the chosen ideals of my Fraternity
Promote the welfare of my profession
Uphold faithfully the traditions and program of my Alma Mater
